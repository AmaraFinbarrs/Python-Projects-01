Relational problem to test programming skills

Question: 

Problem: we have three friends who want to know how much money they have compared to the others. Write a program that would accept the names of three friends and the amount each possesses. The program must output who is richer, but say if someone has the same amount of money as someone else.

The question was gotten from the book: A Python Crash Course Page 50.

I would advice you to try to solve the  problem yourself before looking at the solution.

The process I used to write this program is detailed in Process.txt.

A pictorial representation of the problem can be viewed in the diagram folder.
