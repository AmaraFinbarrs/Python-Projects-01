Relational Python Problem Project

Question: Three friends need to know which one of them is the richest, the second richest and the last. They also want to know if any two or more people have the same value meaning that none of them is the richest. My job is to help them by writing a program to fufill this purpose.

The question was gotten from the book: A Python Crash Course Page 50.

The process I used to write this program is detailed in Process.txt.

A pictorial representation of the problem can be viewed in the diagram folder.
